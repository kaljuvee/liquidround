2. **SELLER_MA** - For companies looking to sell their business or assets
   - Keywords: sell, selling, divest, exit, sale, buyer list, market outreach

3. **IPO** - For companies planning to go public
   - Keywords: ipo, public, listing, public offering, go public, underwriter
   - Examples: "Planning an IPO", "Going public next year"

Instructions:
