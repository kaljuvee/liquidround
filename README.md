- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Streamlit-based UI with suggested queries
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging and tracing of agent activities
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture for easy addition of new agents and workflows

## System Architecture

### Core Agents

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Routes queries to appropriate workflows
2. **Target Finder Agent**: Identifies acquisition targets based on criteria
3. **Valuer Agent**: Performs financial analysis and valuation
4. **Synergy Analyst**: Analyzes potential synergies
5. **Bid Strategist**: Develops bidding strategies
6. **Seller Prep Agent**: Prepares companies for sale
7. **Market Outreach Agent**: Identifies potential buyers
8. **IPO Readiness Assessor**: Evaluates IPO readiness
9. **Memo Writer**: Creates investment committee memoranda

### Workflows

- **Buyer-Led M&A**: Target identification → Valuation → Synergy analysis → Bid strategy
- **Seller-Led M&A**: Seller preparation → Market outreach → Buyer identification
- **IPO**: Readiness assessment → Underwriter selection → Process planning

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaljuvee/liquidround.git

## Development

### Adding New Agents

1. Create agent class in `agents/` directory
2. Add system prompt in `prompts/` directory
3. Update workflow in `workflow.py`
4. Add tests in `tests/` directory

### Customizing Prompts

Agent prompts are stored in the `prompts/` directory as `.md` (Markdown) files. Edit these files to customize agent behavior. The Markdown format allows for better formatting and documentation of prompts.

### Logging

The system provides comprehensive logging:
- Application logs in `logs/liquidround.log`
- Agent-specific logs in `logs/agent_*.log`
- Trace logs for detailed debugging
