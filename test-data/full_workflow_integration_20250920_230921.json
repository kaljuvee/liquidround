Growth rate impacts terminal value.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Valuation Summary & Recommendation\n\n### **Summarized Valuations:**\n\n| Method                     | Valuation Range (USD B) |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|\n| DCF                        | \\$13.5B \u2013 \\$15.0B      |\n| Comparable Company Multiple| \\$17.1B \u2013 \\$19.3B      |\n| Precedent Transactions     | \\$17.5B \u2013 \\$19.7B      |\n\n### **Final Outlook:**\n- The valuation range based on market comparables and precedent deals suggests a fair value around **\\$17\u2013\\$19 billion**.\n- DCF valuation indicates a somewhat lower fair value (~\\$13.5\u2013\\$15B), possibly due to conservative assumptions or market conditions.\n\n### **Investment Recommendation:**\n- Given the strategic importance, high EBITDA margins, and industry premiums, a fair acquisition price is approximately **\\$17\u2013\\$19 billion**.\n- Negotiation should consider the discrepancy between intrinsic DCF valuation and market multiples.\n- A prudent approach would be to target a purchase price near **\\$17B**, aligning with comparable and precedent valuations, while allowing room for negotiations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nCyberArk presents a compelling valuation with consistent multiples and growth prospects. The proposed acquisition value aligns with industry standards, with an emphasis on strategic fit in privileged access management and cloud security.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you require more detailed models or specific analyses.",
